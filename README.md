Wave inverting mode:
Feed a wave from a VCO into Osc1 (e.g. sine, triangle or saw wave).
Feed a clock signal into the Clock input.
At each clock pulse, the wave at the output is inverted.




Wave switching mode:
Feed a wave (VCO1) into Osc1 (e.g. sine, triangle or saw wave).
Feed a second wave (VCO2) into Osc2 (e.g. sine, triangle or saw wave).
Feed a clock signal into the Clock input.
At each clock pulse, the wave at the output is switched {VCO1 to VCO2 or vice versa)
